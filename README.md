# Number_Guessing_Game
A Number Guessing Game in Python is a simple interactive game where the program randomly selects a number within a specified range, and the player tries to guess it. The game gives feedback after each guess, indicating whether the player's guess is too high, too low, or correct. The objective is to guess the correct number with the fewest attempts.
